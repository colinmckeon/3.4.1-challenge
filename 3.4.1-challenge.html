<h1>3.4.1-challenge</h1>

<!--The fist cosole.assert is coming back as undefined because var name in var name = "Jane"; is being
hoisted and there is no value for name. The second assert passed "Jane" because var name = "Jane"; has
been declared and passes as true within the function.  The third console.assert works because var name = "John";
has been declared globally and passes as true. My desciption is probably going to sound off, but I can hopefully
explain it better in person if you would like -->
<script type="text/javascript">

var name = "John";

(function() {
    console.assert(name === undefined); // 1

    var name = "Jane";

    console.assert(name === "Jane"); // 2
})()

console.assert(name === "John"); // 3
